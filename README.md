Compile against different versions using `gradle build "-Pmcversion=1.21.1"`<br>
You can find the versions to compile against inside the versions folder


### Known Issues:
- Smooth zoom does not zoom out smoothly.
- Hand position slightly changes, when toggling smooth zoom on and off.

I will try to update this mod as quickly as possible to the latest version, but no guarantees. Latest snapshot update is not possible right now, due to dependencies, that aren't updated yet.
